    <!-- Collaborator #1: Create a header for the webpage-->
    <h1>Team Royal Blue</h1>
    <!-- Collaborator #2: Find an image to add to the webpage -->

    <!-- Collaborator #3: Add a link to the webpage -->

    <!-- All Collaborators: Add some text to the page-->
<p>---Sample Text---</p>
    <p>And now, some more text in which the meaning doesn’t matter but is just supposed to fill up the page. Yep, some more words, words, a word is the smallest unit of isolated meaning in a language. All the sounds in every lanuguage in the world can fit on a sheet of paper, a few charts: the International Phonetic Alphabet. Yet, many are unable to pronnounce sounds which are not native to their language. Some finding maybe a rolled r difficult, or tones in a languages like Chinese indistinguishable. Why are you even reading this right now? I just went on a ramble about some linguistics. Why would I even say something profound in the sample text? Mate: quit reading. Stop! Okay fine, I’ll make you stop by ending the paragraph.</p>
